# Code-Refactor-HW-DLabins
Homework 1

The purpose of this project was to provide a marketing company (Horiseon) with a more accessible webpage. In order to fulfill this challenge, the developer utilized semantic HTML language to make changes to the existing div tags. Changes to the original version can be seen and understood by the use of comments explaining what and where the changes were made. The goal of optimizing the webpage for accessibility in various search engines was achieved using the following acceptance criteria:
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
